Person Development Plan

My strong points that would be applicable to working in a team is flexibility and communication. In previous group projects I have been flexible in terms of what task I have to do in that group that may not have been what I wanted to do. Also, I communicated the issues that I had with that task, and other team members were able to help me. 

My weaker points in group projects are delegation of tasks and planning. In previous group projects, I was not too good at delegating the tasks and planning the project. Instead, we would just start doing the project and planning along the way.

My learning goal during this project is learn how an application is actually developed in a team. How the planning is done, and how the work should be delegated.
This is important to me, as I believe it is very applicable to a possible future profession.
I will hopefully achieve this goal by the end of this project.

As of now, I am working with my team to achieve this goal.

What’s stopping me from reaching my goal is laziness. Planning ahead of a project is “less fun” than just starting. However, in this project I will do my best not to do that.

The first step to reaching my goal is am writing this, becoming aware of my goals and how to reach them.
