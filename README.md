My strong points that would be applicable to working in a team is flexibility and communication. In previous group projects I have been flexible in terms of what task I have to do in that group that may not have been what I wanted to do. Also, I communicated the issues that I had with that task, and other team members were able to help me. 

My weaker points in group projects are delegation of tasks and planning. In previous group projects, I was not too good at delegating the tasks and planning the project. Instead, we would just start doing the project and planning along the way.

My learning goal during this project is learn how an application is actually developed in a team. How the planning is done, and how the work should be delegated.
This is important to me, as I believe it is very applicable to a possible future profession.
I will hopefully achieve this goal by the end of this project.

As of now, I am working with my team to achieve this goal.

What’s stopping me from reaching my goal is laziness. Planning ahead of a project is “less fun” than just starting. However, in this project I will do my best not to do that.

The first step to reaching my goal is am writing this, becoming aware of my goals and how to reach them.

My strong points regarding this project, meaning what would be applicable in this case,
are communication and planning. I think these are shown in a team-based project since I
am able to communicate and interact well with others while also planning ahead of time.
However, one of my weak points might be that I sometimes seem to be a bit bossy and
therefore tend to influnece my ideas on others. Other than that, I think that I am
suitable for a team-project.

My goal regarding this project is to learn useful skills for a future job in IT, since
this is one of my first real big team-based project. I would also like to learn more
regarding graphical interfaces, since I really enjoy this part in such a project and
I feel like I can improve more.

Right now, my team and I are just starting this project. I am willing to dedicate
as much time as possible in order to get a maximum grade(and I think my teammates are
willing to do the same), since I think as long as we put in the work and follow the
guidelines we are going to be able to achieve this goal. I strongly believe that my
teammates are serious about this project and that we are going to do a really good job.

Strong Points:

1.Complex Problem Solving - mainly algorithmic problems,
coming up with efficient and fully working solutions for various
problems. I believe this will be useful in a team environment
for handling various complex aspects (mainly features/functionality)
of the application as well as providing code analysis.

2.Planning & Analysis - I have a strong tendency to first analyze
and research what's the quickest and most effective approach to
a certain problem (e.g. what data structures to use, what to use
to implement certain functionality, what database to implement, etc.).
I believe this is highly useful in a team to avoid issues later on
and have an effective solution on the first or second attempt at a
problem.

Weak Points:

1.Design - I feel like I lack creativity and
control on design in general (UI mainly), therefore I feel
like this should not be my main role in a team.

2.Lack of Team Work Experience - the majority of my time I have
only worked on independent projects and tasks, therefore I believe
there will be some difficulty adapting to team work, but I am
prepared to fix this issue and adapt to a team based environment.

Goals:
* Learn to work efficiently in a team (learn Scrum, Agile)
* Learn to reach high and efficient test coverage.
* Learn to plan effectively in a team-based environment.

I believe I will have successfully achieved this goal if we (me and my team)
manage to finish the project in time and according to plan in the period of the course.

Project Expectations:
* Learn efficient planning & team work (Scrum, Agile)
* Become more comfortable in git
* Learn some new, undiscovered things in Java (JavaFX, database implementation, APIs)
* Gain feedback on the process (rather than the product) of our work
