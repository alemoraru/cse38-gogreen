**Things to discuss/solve**
---

1. Discuss the details of what the application will actually do.
Discuss what each "page" entails, in detail, such as where to put the stats, 
which "page" represents/does what etc.
2. Discuss what sort of features we would like to implement, regarding
things such as statistics, achievements, bonus features etc. ( It will make 
implementing the GUI much easier and overall pre-settle a good structure for our 
app to start with)
3. Create UML diagram for work distribution( backend, frontend), thus organising
our workload per person.
4. Choose a git branching strategy that we are going to use for the project.
5. Set up necessities for the .gitignore
6. Install mockito ( used for testing ) - also adjust project accordingly.
