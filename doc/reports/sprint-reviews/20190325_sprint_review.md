# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: We had some work distribution problems at the beginning, however we fixed that by assigning more people to a more complex issue.

### Problem 2: Bonus Issues : we focused a lot on bonus features, however a basic feature was neglected, mainly the progression system.
 

## Adjustments from previous sprints
  - We now fully incorporated code reviews into our merging strategy, hence spotting any errors that our peers did.
  - A lot more work was done.

## Adjustments for next sprint
 - Work even more efficiently
 - Continue distributing efficiently
