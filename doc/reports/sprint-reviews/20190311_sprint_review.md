# Sprint Review

## Main problems  Encountered

### Problem 1: Lack of work for some teammates
Some teammates were done in a few days with their work and had nothing else to do for the rest of the week, while others
could only finish the work on the last day. We need some balancing of the workload.

### Problem 2: Coordination
The team had some coordination issues, as multiple teammates did pretty much the same work on separate branches, which caused conflicts in
the end.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
  - This week, we seem to be more productive, as everyone had at least something to work on.
  - Coordination - group members interact way more in between than previous weeks. However, this still needs some work.
  - Issue solving - we seem to be solving problems now more efficiently (technical, code, etc.)

## Adjustments for next sprint
  - Work distribution - we have now assigned even more work for everyone, planned more ahead. To be determined how it goes this week.
  - Focus more on the bigger picture of the application, and understand the consequences of our current actions
